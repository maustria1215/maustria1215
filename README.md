- ðŸ‘‹ Hi, Iâ€™m Michael Austria.

- I graduated from SUNY Geneseo with an accounting degree in 2015. After graduation, I interned at the Disney College Program in Orlando, Florida, where I was involved in outdoor food and beverage. I was responsible for stocking and money management in the parks. After the program, I went into math tutoring and studied Mathematics Education at Queens College, where received my Bachelor's and Master's degrees.  As the pandemic arose, and every school was transitioning to remote learning, I adjusted to the tools swiftly and was able to educate students to get them prepared for higher-level mathematics.  

- I have been a math teacher for 4 years, but involved with math education for 9 years. I love inspiring students with mathematics, and helping students gain confidence in their math abilities.  As a math teacher, I believe that teachers not only teach the computation of math but also the problem-solving and real-world application.  I believe that teachers should teach subjects as something that students can use every day. Students should not only learn just to do well on an exam but also learn how what they are learning during class can potentially help them in the future. If students can apply mathematics outside the classroom, they will truly appreciate mathematics.  I also have the privilege to coach my students in track and field and cross country, where we go to meets and compete with schools across New York City. 

- I am also a runner who is involved in the community.  I am involved with a running group Queens Distance Runners, where we host events all over New York, including weekly runs, workouts, and special events.  I currently co-lead the Flushing group run, where I help pace runners, lead a safe route for everyone, and help them feel comfortable running or walking with us.
